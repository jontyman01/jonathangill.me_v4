                      For the design team at Keelvar, simplifying the complex defines our priority on any project. While this is an essential aim for any product team, the tasks that procurement professionals face on a daily basis can be highly specialized, labour intensive, and can require a high cognitive load. By gaining a deep knowledge in the product team of our customers needs and pain points, and by using the design thinking process to Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test, we aim to simplify the complex in measurable ways.
                    </p>

                    <p className="pb-4">
                      As an example, lets take rate management. In mid sized to large businesses, procurement teams have various methods of storing the agreed prices for contracts, in what is called a Rate Card - for instance, a contract for a shipping container of raw materials going from Southampton to Cork for the year. Initial customer interviews revealed that procurement teams were struggling with fragmented systems, labor-intensive manual processes, and inefficient rate tracking and reporting.

However, we aimed to go beyond Excel by incorporating powerful features like advanced filtering to facilitate managing vast rate cards - some with up to 100,000 rates.</p>

                <p className="text-lg pb-4 leading-loose">After multiple rounds of iterations on prototypes, validating high level concepts with customers, a development team was assembled. I worked closely with engineers to ensure technical feasibility of designs. I also contributed to front-end QA, leveraging my technical background to test in-app designs before deployment. After launching the alpha version, I led think out loud user testing sessions with customers, internal stakeholders, and non-expert users, validating uncovering critical usability insights before launch. </p>
